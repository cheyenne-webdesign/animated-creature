      <h1>Atlas</h1>
      <p>Atlas is an alien from the planet of Andromeda, in a galaxy far from ours. Aliens don't like humans, they believe human interaction is a death sentence. However, Atlas is being sent to Earth for a mission he was destined for. Upon arrival, Atlas didn't experience the fear of death, instead was thrown into a dance party! On his home planet, atlas was the kin of dance-offs, and he proved that to the humans. Thankfully, his mission is now over after winning, and now he's celebratory dancing among the stars. </p>
